# `See`

A high-performance, asynchronous runtime-agnostic alternative to `tokio::sync::watch`. It uses `parking_lot::RwLock` and `event-listener` as its underlying implementation and provides a `tokio`-compatible API.

## Cross-Runtime Compatibility

This library is completely runtime-agnostic and does not rely on any specific scheduler. It can be used seamlessly in various asynchronous environments such as `smol`, and others(non-tested).

## Performance Advantages

In most scenarios, its measured performance is superior to `tokio`'s native implementation.
