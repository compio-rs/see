//! Synchronized watch channel implementation.
//!
//! This module provides a watch channel implementation that is thread-safe
//! and can be used in multi-threaded contexts. It uses `parking_lot::RwLock`
//! for efficient read-write locking and `event-listener` for async
//! notifications.
//!
//! If you don't need thread-safety and want a lighter-weight alternative,
//! consider using the [`unsync`](crate::unsync) module.
